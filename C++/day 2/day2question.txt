Day-1

Task-1

1. Find the nth bit of a given number.
2. Check whether x=10 and y=?(user input) are same w/o using comparison operator.
3. Find the Fibonacci Series up-to 'n' terms w/o using Arrays.
4. Display the ASCII Table.

Task-2

Operators and Control Structures
The program adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides simple integers. When the program is running, it zeros the result register and displays its contents. The user can then type in an operator and number. The result are updated and displayed. The following operators are valid:

Operator  Meaning

+   Addition

-   Subtraction

*   Multiplication

/   Division

Example (user input is in boldface)

calc

Result: 0

Enter operator and number: + 123

Result: 123

Enter operator and number: - 23

Result: 100

Enter operator and number: / 25

Result: 4

Enter operator and number: * 4

Result: 16

Program to clear the specified bit of a number.

Write a C program which reads an integer n and prints a twin prime which has the maximum size among twin primes less than or equals to n.

According to wikipedia "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2

more than another prime number" for example, either member of the twin prime

pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two".

Program to check the two given numbers are same or equal without using any comparison operator.

Program to print series using function: x + x^3/3! + x^5/5! +…….+ x^n/n!

Write a C program to which reads n digits chosen from 0 to 9 and counts the number of combinations where the sum of the digits equals to given number. Do not use the same digits in a combination.

For example, the combinations where n = 2 and s = 5 are as follows:

0 + 5 = 5

1 + 4 = 5

3 + 2 = 5

Print a checkerboard (8-by-8 grid). Each square should be 5-by-3 characters wide. A 2-by-2 example follows:

|     |     |
+-----+-----+
|     |     |
|     |     |
